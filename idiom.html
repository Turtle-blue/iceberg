        <b> Meaning and Usage? </b>
        <br>
        <p1>"The tip of the iceberg" is an idiom.  When only a part of something is apparent, but reallly there is much more, what you see is just the tip
          of the iceberg.
          In conclusion, "the tip of the iceberg" means that there is more to the situation than it seems.</p>
        <b> Origin </b>
        <br>
        <p1> Icebergs are well known for being much larger beneath water than above, which can be quite dangerous for ships. A famous ship, the <i> Titanic, </i> sank after crashing into an iceberg, though many people think that was not the only reason it sank.  </p>
